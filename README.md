# Beginners-Keras-DQN
Beginners DQN Cartpole and Lunar Lander

Creating a repo for non-object oriented versions of Vanilla DQN. 
I know this is not the efficient, elegant way of implementing DQN, 
but I think its valuable for beginners [it was for me :)] because you can follow straight through.  The implementation and comments follow as closely as possible to the Deepmind Nature paper. 
Start with cartpole,it is the most simple.
